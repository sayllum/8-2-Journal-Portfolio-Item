How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
<br><i>
When I interpret user needs, I like to picture myself in their shoes and as the person who will be the end user. Creating user stories helps because it is a general explanation of the required outcome, written from the end users point of view. It gives a reason as to why the request is imperative to the user and the clients end experience.
